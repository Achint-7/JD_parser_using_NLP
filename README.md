# JD Parser using NLP

## Overview

This project focuses on developing a Job Description (JD) Parser using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The JD Parser extracts key information from job descriptions, helping to categorize and analyze the requirements of different job roles. This tool is valuable for recruiters, HR professionals, and job seekers in efficiently understanding the skills and qualifications associated with specific positions.

## Features

- **Text Extraction**: The parser uses NLP techniques to extract relevant information such as job title, skills, qualifications, and responsibilities from job descriptions.

- **Keyword Analysis**: The tool performs keyword analysis to identify the most frequently mentioned skills and qualifications within a set of job descriptions.

- **Categorization**: Job descriptions can be categorized based on common attributes, making it easier to filter and compare positions.

## Customization

Customize the project based on your requirements:

- **Supported Languages**: The NLP model can be trained on different languages to support job descriptions in various languages.

- **Additional Attributes**: Extend the parser to extract additional information or specific attributes based on your needs.

- **Integration with Database**: Modify the scripts to store parsed data in a database for further analysis and reporting.

## Dependencies

- **spaCy**: The project relies on the spaCy library for natural language processing.

- **spaCy Language Model**: Download a spaCy language model, such as `en_core_web_sm`.
